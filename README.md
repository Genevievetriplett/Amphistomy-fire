These are the R scripts and data I used to analyze and visualize my findings from "Stomatal Distribution and Post-fire Recovery: Intra- and Interspecific Variation in Plants of the Pyrogenic Florida Scrub."

There are three experiments included here:

1. Interspecific survey of stomatal distribution in 116 plant species from the Florida scrub
Analyzed whether the presence of amphistomy (stomata on both leaf surfaces) correlates with various factors

Subsetted a phylogenetic tree using a pre-existing one

Used Blomberg's K to test for phylogenetic signal of amphistomy

Performed a Pagel's (1994) analysis to assess correlation with post-fire recovery method

2. Direct experiment on intraspecific variation in stomatal traits
Sampled resprouting palmettos to measure stomatal ratio and density before and after either a controlled burn or manual removal of all above-ground leaves

Analyzed differences post-treatment using t-tests and linear models

3. Indirect experiment on intraspecific variation in stomatal traits
Sampled long-lived leaves from palmettos at 12 sites burned 0.5â€“50 years ago

Constructed linear mixed-effects models with time-since-fire as a fixed effect and site as a random effect to analyze differences in both stomatal ratio and stomatal density

Used two methods: (1) compared within-individual responses using their oldest vs. newest leaves, and (2) compared across individuals while holding leaf age relatively constant

This was my first experience with both R and GitHub, and I largely taught myself (as you can probably tell). Please feel free to message me if you run into any issues!
